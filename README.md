# Fake E-commerce Website
# Description
This project represents a website that can be used to sell clothing online by a supplier brand. The site is not fully functional as not all images are clickable because they are not included in the products.json document. Additionally, orders are not placed in fact because the data does not reach an admin. This was created with the purpose of practicing certain concepts and better understanding how JavaScript works.

# Functionality
- The user can admire the available products;
- The user can add the products in the cart and even place an order after filling the details form (click on Shop page - the first 3 products are saved in the products.json file);
- The user can read more about the brand (named PureLines), and also view the blog page;
- The website is responsive to most phone, pads and monitor screen sizes.

# Future changes
- Making all the photos clickable
- Creating a form where the user can sign in before placing an order
- Designing an admin interface so that the brand provider to handle all the orders.
